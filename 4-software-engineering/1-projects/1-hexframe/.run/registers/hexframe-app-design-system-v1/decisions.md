  The choices the autonomous run made while making the design system
  hexframe's, where a ticket left room: what each use of the retired brand
  colour became, what "dark by default" leaves of the system's preference, and
  how the radius scale squares every corner.

# Decisions

### DEC-1 Each use of `brand` moves to the ink, but the move in progress, which is the human's

HEX-92. `brand`, the purple, had five uses; each went to what it meant, by DIRECTION's principles 3 and 4 (amber says "you", not "here"; a primary button is quiet):

- **A tile's and a frame's hover stroke** (`ui/hex/Tile.tsx`, `ui/hex/Frame.tsx`): `primary`, the ink. A hover says "here", and the center's line is neutral for the same reason.
- **The swap button** (`ui/hex/Tile.tsx`, `SwapButton`): `primary` with `primary-foreground`, a quiet button.
- **The import's drop zone while a drag is over it** (`features/system/import/Import.tsx`): `primary`, "here" again.
- **The banner of a move in progress** (`features/system/System.tsx`): `human`, since it marks what you are doing, as the rule beside your words does.

The proposals (HEX-104, HEX-105) redraw the tile, its hover and its swap; these are the stand-ins until they land.

### DEC-2 Dark by default means the system's preference no longer counts

HEX-92. The design system's "Installing it" says the project puts `dark` on `<html>` "unless the user chose light", and DIRECTION makes dark the default. `themeScript` now paints dark unless the stored choice, made with the toggle, is light; an OS set to light no longer picks light on a first visit, where it did before. `useThemeState`'s server render starts from dark to match.

### DEC-3 The whole radius scale is a multiple of `--radius`

HEX-92. The registry sets `--radius: 0rem` and leaves the scale to shadcn's `init`. The app's scale came from an older `init`, `calc(var(--radius) - 4px)` to `calc(var(--radius) + 4px)`, which keeps `rounded-xl` at 4px when the radius is 0. `styles.css` now writes every step, `xs` to `4xl`, as a multiple of `--radius`, the form shadcn's current `init` uses, so no token rounds a corner. A literal radius stays as written (the tooltip's arrow, `rounded-[2px]`), and `rounded-full` stays round on purpose.
